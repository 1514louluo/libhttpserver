This is true for query arguments and for *POST* and *PUT*\r\nrequests bodies if *application/x-www-form-urlencoded* or\r\n*multipart/form-data* header are passed.\r\n\r\nThe header reproduce all the constants defined by libhttpserver.\r\nThese maps various constant used by the HTTP protocol that are exported\r\nas a convenience for users of the library. Is is possible for the user\r\nto define their own extensions of the HTTP standard and use those with\r\nlibhttpserver.\r\n\r\nAll functions are guaranteed to be completely reentrant and\r\nthread-safe (unless differently specified).\r\nAdditionally, clients can specify resource limits on the overall\r\nnumber of connections, number of connections per IP address and memory\r\nused per connection to avoid resource exhaustion.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n* g++ >= 4.1.2\r\n* libmicrohttpd >= 0.9.7\r\n* doxygen (if you want to build code reference)\r\n\r\nCompilation\r\n===========\r\nlibhttpserver uses the standard system where the usual build process\r\ninvolves running\r\n> ./bootstrap  \r\n> mkdir build  \r\n> cd build  \r\n> ../configure  \r\n> make  \r\n> make install  \r\n\r\nOptional parameters to configure script\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nA complete list of parameters can be obtained running 'configure --help'.\r\nHere are listed the libhttpserver specific options (the canonical configure options are also supported).\r\n\r\n* --enable-same-directory-build: enable to compile in the same directory. This is heavily discouraged. (def=no)\r\n* --enable-debug: enable debug data generation (def=no)\r\n* --enable-cpp11: enable c++11 std classes (def=no)\r\n* --disable-doxygen-doc: don't generate any doxygen documentation\r\n* --disable-doxygen-dot: don't generate graphics for doxygen documentation\r\n* --disable-doxygen-man: don't generate doxygen manual pages\r\n* --enable-doxygen-rtf: generate doxygen RTF documentation\r\n* --enable-doxygen-xml: generate doxygen XML documentation\r\n* --enable-doxygen-chm: generate doxygen compressed HTML help documentation\r\n* --enable-doxygen-chi: generate doxygen seperate compressed HTML help index file\r\n* --disable-doxygen-html: don't generate doxygen plain HTML documentation\r\n* --enable-doxygen-ps: generate doxygen PostScript documentation\r\n* --enable-doxygen-pdf: generate doxygen PDF documentation\r\n\r\nConstants\r\n=========\r\nW.I.P.\r\n\r\nStructures and classes type definition\r\n======================================\r\n* http_resource (CPP class): Represents the resource associated with a specific http endpoint.\r\n* http_request (CPP class): Represents the request received by the resource that process it.\r\n* http_response (CPP class): Represents the response sent by the server once the resource finished its work.\r\n* event_supplier (CPP class): Represents a class that supplies events to the webserver. It can be used to trigger the internal select of it.\r\n* webserver (CPP class): Represents the daemon listening on a socket for HTTP traffic.\r\n\r\nGNU Lesser General Public License\r\n=================================\r\n\r\nVersion 2.1, February 1999\r\n\r\nCopyright &copy; 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\n_This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\r\nas the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\r\nthe version number 2.1._\r\n\r\n### Preamble\r\n\r\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your\r\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\r\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\r\n\r\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\r\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\r\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\r\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\r\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\r\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\r\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\r\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\r\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\r\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\r\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\r\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\r\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\r\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\r\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\r\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\r\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\r\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\r\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n\r\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\r\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\r\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\r\n\r\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\r\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\r\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\r\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\r\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\r\nintroduced by others.\r\n\r\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\r\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\r\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\r\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\r\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\r\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\r\n\r\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\r\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\r\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\r\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\r\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\r\nlibraries into non-free programs.\r\n\r\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\r\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\r\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\r\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\r\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\r\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\r\nthe library.\r\n\r\nWe call this license the &ldquo;Lesser&rdquo; General Public License because it\r\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\r\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\r\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\r\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\r\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\r\nspecial circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\r\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\r\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\r\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\r\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\r\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\r\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\r\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\r\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\r\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\r\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\r\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\r\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\r\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\r\n\r\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\r\n&ldquo;work based on the library&rdquo; and a &ldquo;work that uses the library&rdquo;.  The\r\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\r\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\r\n\r\n### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n**0.** This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\r\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\r\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\r\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called &ldquo;this License&rdquo;).\r\nEach licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nA &ldquo;library&rdquo; means a collection of software functions and/or data\r\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\r\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\r\n\r\nThe &ldquo;Library&rdquo;, below, refers to any such software library or work\r\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A &ldquo;work based on the\r\nLibrary&rdquo; means either the Library or any derivative work under\r\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\r\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\r\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\r\nincluded without limitation in the term &ldquo;modification&rdquo;.)\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\r\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\r\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\r\nand installation of the library.\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\r\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\r\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\r\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\r\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\r\n\r\n**1.** You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\r\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\r\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\r\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\r\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\r\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\r\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\r\nfee.\r\n\r\n**2.** You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n* **a)** The modified work must itself be a software library.\r\n* **b)** You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\r\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n* **c)** You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\r\ncharge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\r\n* **d)** If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\r\ntable of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\r\nthe facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\r\nis invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\r\nin the event an application does not supply such function or\r\ntable, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\r\nits purpose remains meaningful.  \r\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\r\na purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\r\napplication.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\r\napplication-supplied function or table used by this function must\r\nbe optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\r\nroot function must still compute square roots.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Library.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\r\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\r\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\nthe scope of this License.\r\n\r\n**3.** You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\r\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\r\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\r\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\r\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\r\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\r\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\r\nthese notices.\r\n\r\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\r\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\r\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\r\n\r\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\r\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\r\n\r\n**4.** You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\r\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\r\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\r\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\r\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\r\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\r\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\r\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\r\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n**5.** A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\r\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\r\nlinked with it, is called a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo;.  Such a\r\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\r\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\r\n\r\nHowever, linking a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; with the Library\r\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\r\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a &ldquo;work that uses the\r\nlibrary&rdquo;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\r\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\r\n\r\nWhen a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; uses material from a header file\r\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\r\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\r\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\r\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\r\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\r\n\r\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\r\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\r\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\r\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\r\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\r\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\r\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\r\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\r\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\r\n\r\n**6.** As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\r\nlink a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; with the Library to produce a\r\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\r\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\r\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\r\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\r\n\r\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\r\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\r\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\r\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\r\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\r\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\r\nof these things:\r\n\r\n* **a)** Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\r\nmachine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\r\nchanges were used in the work (which must be distributed under\r\nSections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\r\nwith the Library, with the complete machine-readable &ldquo;work that\r\nuses the Library&rdquo;, as object code and/or source code, so that the\r\nuser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\r\nexecutable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\r\nthat the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\r\nLibrary will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\r\nto use the modified definitions.)\r\n* **b)** Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\r\nLibrary.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\r\ncopy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\r\nrather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\r\nwill operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\r\nthe user installs one, as long as the modified version is\r\ninterface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\r\n* **c)** Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\r\nleast three years, to give the same user the materials\r\nspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\r\nthan the cost of performing this distribution.\r\n* **d)** If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\r\nfrom a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\r\nspecified materials from the same place.\r\n* **e)** Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\r\nmaterials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\r\n\r\nFor an executable, the required form of the &ldquo;work that uses the\r\nLibrary&rdquo; must include any data and utility programs needed for\r\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\r\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\r\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\r\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\r\nthe executable.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\r\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\r\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\r\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\r\ndistribute.\r\n\r\n**7.** You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\r\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\r\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\r\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\r\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\r\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\r\n\r\n* **a)** Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\r\nbased on the Library, uncombined with any other library\r\nfacilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\r\nSections above.\r\n* **b)** Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\r\nthat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\r\nwhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\r\n\r\n**8.** You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\r\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\r\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\r\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\r\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\r\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\r\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n**9.** You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\r\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Library or works based on it.\r\n\r\n**10.** Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\r\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\r\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n**11.** If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\r\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\r\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n**12.** If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\r\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\r\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\r\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\r\nwritten in the body of this License.\r\n\r\n**13.** The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\r\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\r\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\r\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\r\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\r\n&ldquo;any later version&rdquo;, you have the option of following the terms and\r\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\r\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n**14.** If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\r\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\r\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\r\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\r\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\r\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\r\nand reuse of software generally.\r\n\r\n### NO WARRANTY\r\n\r\n**15.** BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\r\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\r\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\r\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\r\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\r\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\r\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n**16.** IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\r\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\r\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\r\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\r\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\r\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\r\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\r\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\nDAMAGES.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\r\n\r\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\r\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\r\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\r\nordinary General Public License).\r\n\r\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\r\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n&ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\r\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\r\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\r\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\r\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\nschool, if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the library, if\r\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n\r\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\r\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\r\n\r\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\r\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it!\r\n\r\nGNU Free Documentation License\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nVersion 1.3, 3 November 2008\r\n\r\nCopyright &copy; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<http://fsf.org/>&gt;\r\n\r\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\n### 0. PREAMBLE\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\r\nfunctional and useful document &ldquo;free&rdquo; in the sense of freedom: to\r\nassure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,\r\nwith or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.\r\nSecondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\r\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible\r\nfor modifications made by others.\r\n\r\nThis License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative\r\nworks of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It\r\ncomplements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft\r\nlicense designed for free software.\r\n\r\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free\r\nsoftware, because free software needs free documentation: a free\r\nprogram should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the\r\nsoftware does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;\r\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\r\nwhether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License\r\nprincipally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that\r\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be\r\ndistributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a\r\nworld-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that\r\nwork under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,\r\nrefers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a\r\nlicensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you\r\ncopy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission\r\nunder copyright law.\r\n\r\nA &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the\r\nDocument or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with\r\nmodifications and/or translated into another language.\r\n\r\nA &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of\r\nthe Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the\r\npublishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall\r\nsubject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall\r\ndirectly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in\r\npart a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain\r\nany mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical\r\nconnection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,\r\ncommercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles\r\nare designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice\r\nthat says that the Document is released under this License.  If a\r\nsection does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\r\nallowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero\r\nInvariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant\r\nSections then there are none.\r\n\r\nThe &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,\r\nas Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that\r\nthe Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may\r\nbe at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\r\n\r\nA &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,\r\nrepresented in a format whose specification is available to the\r\ngeneral public, that is suitable for revising the document\r\nstraightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of\r\npixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available\r\ndrawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or\r\nfor automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input\r\nto text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file\r\nformat whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart\r\nor discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.\r\nAn image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount\r\nof text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain\r\nASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML\r\nor XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple\r\nHTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of\r\ntransparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats\r\ninclude proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by\r\nproprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or\r\nprocessing tools are not generally available, and the\r\nmachine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word\r\nprocessors for output purposes only.\r\n\r\nThe &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,\r\nplus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material\r\nthis License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in\r\nformats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means\r\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,\r\npreceding the beginning of the body of the text.\r\n\r\nThe &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies of\r\nthe Document to the public.\r\n\r\nA section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose\r\ntitle either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following\r\ntext that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a\r\nspecific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,\r\n&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;\r\nof such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\r\nsection &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.\r\n\r\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which\r\nstates that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty\r\nDisclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this\r\nLicense, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\r\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has\r\nno effect on the meaning of this License.\r\n\r\n### 2. VERBATIM COPYING\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either\r\ncommercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the\r\ncopyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies\r\nto the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no\r\nother conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use\r\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further\r\ncopying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept\r\ncompensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough\r\nnumber of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\r\n\r\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and\r\nyou may publicly display copies.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\r\n\r\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have\r\nprinted covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\r\nDocument's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the\r\ncopies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover\r\nTexts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\r\nthe back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify\r\nyou as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present\r\nthe full title with all words of the title equally prominent and\r\nvisible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.\r\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve\r\nthe title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated\r\nas verbatim copying in other respects.\r\n\r\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit\r\nlegibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit\r\nreasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent\r\npages.\r\n\r\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering\r\nmore than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent\r\ncopy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy\r\na computer-network location from which the general network-using\r\npublic has access to download using public-standard network protocols\r\na complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\r\nIf you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,\r\nwhen you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure\r\nthat this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated\r\nlocation until at least one year after the last time you distribute an\r\nOpaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\r\nedition to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the\r\nDocument well before redistributing any large number of copies, to\r\ngive them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the\r\nDocument.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 4. MODIFICATIONS\r\n\r\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under\r\nthe conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release\r\nthe Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified\r\nVersion filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution\r\nand modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy\r\nof it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\r\n\r\n* **A.** Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct\r\nfrom that of the Document, and from those of previous versions\r\n(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section\r\nof the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version\r\nif the original publisher of that version gives permission.\r\n* **B.** List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities\r\nresponsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified\r\nVersion, together with at least five of the principal authors of the\r\nDocument (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),\r\nunless they release you from this requirement.\r\n* **C.** State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the\r\nModified Version, as the publisher.\r\n* **D.** Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\r\n* **E.** Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications\r\nadjacent to the other copyright notices.\r\n* **F.** Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice\r\ngiving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the\r\nterms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\r\n* **G.** Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections\r\nand required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.\r\n* **H.** Include an unaltered copy of this License.\r\n* **I.** Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add\r\nto it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and\r\npublisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If\r\nthere is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one\r\nstating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as\r\ngiven on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified\r\nVersion as stated in the previous sentence.\r\n* **J.** Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for\r\npublic access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise\r\nthe network locations given in the Document for previous versions\r\nit was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section.\r\nYou may omit a network location for a work that was published at\r\nleast four years before the Document itself, or if the original\r\npublisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\r\n* **K.** For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;,\r\nPreserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all\r\nthe substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements\r\nand/or dedications given therein.\r\n* **L.** Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,\r\nunaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers\r\nor the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\r\n* **M.** Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section\r\nmay not be included in the Modified Version.\r\n* **N.** Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;\r\nor to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\r\n* **O.** Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or\r\nappendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material\r\ncopied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all\r\nof these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the\r\nlist of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.\r\nThese titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\r\n\r\nYou may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains\r\nnothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various\r\nparties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has\r\nbeen approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a\r\npassage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list\r\nof Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of\r\nFront-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or\r\nthrough arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already\r\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or\r\nby arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,\r\nyou may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit\r\npermission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\r\n\r\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License\r\ngive permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or\r\nimply endorsement of any Modified Version.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this\r\nLicense, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\r\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the\r\nInvariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\r\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its\r\nlicense notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\r\n\r\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and\r\nmultiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single\r\ncopy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but\r\ndifferent contents, make the title of each such section unique by\r\nadding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original\r\nauthor or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.\r\nMake the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of\r\nInvariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\r\n\r\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;\r\nin the various original documents, forming one section Entitled\r\n&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,\r\nand any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all sections\r\nEntitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\r\n\r\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other\r\ndocuments released under this License, and replace the individual\r\ncopies of this License in the various documents with a single copy\r\nthat is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules\r\nof this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all\r\nother respects.\r\n\r\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and\r\ndistribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a\r\ncopy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this\r\nLicense in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\r\n\r\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate\r\nand independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or\r\ndistribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright\r\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights\r\nof the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.\r\nWhen the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not\r\napply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\r\nderivative works of the Document.\r\n\r\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these\r\ncopies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of\r\nthe entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on\r\ncovers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\r\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.\r\nOtherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole\r\naggregate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 8. TRANSLATION\r\n\r\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\r\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.\r\nReplacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special\r\npermission from their copyright holders, but you may include\r\ntranslations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the\r\noriginal versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a\r\ntranslation of this License, and all the license notices in the\r\nDocument, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include\r\nthe original English version of this License and the original versions\r\nof those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between\r\nthe translation and the original version of this License or a notice\r\nor disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\r\n\r\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,\r\n&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve\r\nits Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 9. TERMINATION\r\n\r\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and\r\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\r\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\r\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\r\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\r\nfails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\r\n60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\r\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\r\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\r\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\r\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\r\nyour receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\r\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\r\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\r\nreinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does\r\nnot give you any rights to use it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\r\n\r\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the\r\nGNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions\r\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\r\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.  See\r\n&lt;<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>&gt;.\r\n\r\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.\r\nIf the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this\r\nLicense &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of\r\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that specified version or\r\nof any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the\r\nFree Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version\r\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not\r\nas a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document\r\nspecifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this\r\nLicense can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a\r\nversion permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the\r\nDocument.\r\n\r\n### 11. RELICENSING\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any\r\nWorld Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also\r\nprovides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A\r\npublic wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A\r\n&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the site\r\nmeans any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 \r\nlicense published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit \r\ncorporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, \r\nCalifornia, as well as future copyleft versions of that license \r\npublished by that same organization.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in \r\npart, as part of another Document.\r\n\r\nAn MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this \r\nLicense, and if all works that were first published under this License \r\nsomewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or \r\nin part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and \r\n(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\r\n\r\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site\r\nunder CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,\r\nprovided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\r\n\r\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of\r\nthe License in the document and put the following copyright and\r\nlicense notices just after the title page:\r\n\r\n    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.\r\n    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\r\n    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\r\n    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\r\n    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\r\n    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled &ldquo;GNU\r\n    Free Documentation License&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,\r\nreplace the `with...Texts.` line with this:\r\n\r\n    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\r\n    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\r\n\r\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other\r\ncombination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we\r\nrecommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of\r\nfree software license, such as the GNU General Public License,\r\nto permit their use in free software.\r\n","google":"UA-49283858-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
